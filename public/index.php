                            <p>My name is Letitia and I am currently studying Digital Media Design at Bournemouth University. I was previously studying a BTEC television and film diploma at Bexhill College which consisted of various unit projects where some would relate to digital design. For example, I have done a lot of video editing on premiere, web design on Dreamweaver, and designing posters and logos using Photoshop. I have a strong interest in animation where I would work on projects out of educational hours. The outline of this is that I enjoy creating new ideas within a visual aspect such as character design, logos, and more. I am very interested in learning new things, including  web, graphic and game design.</p>

                            <p>Not that normal but what is normal really?
Digital media for me is an oppotunity to create, recreate and imagine things that are just not possible in the world of analog.
I enjoy photo manipulation, ripping real worlds apart and stiching them together to create seamless, realistic-fantasy realms.
Currently enjoying uni and all the skills i'm learning on this course, A little rough around the edges but I'm confident in my future with this course.</p>

                            <p>I'm currently a first year student studying Digital Media Design at Bournemouth University. I am extremely passionate about anything visual whether itâ€™s web design, 3D modeling and animation or infographics, I really like the idea that graphics can change peoples emotions, feeling and even make them do things (like buying a product). I currently do motion graphics for clients in my spare time. However my true passion lies in downhill mountain biking. I truly love how free you feel as you are going over terrain, jumps, drops and rocks which don't look rideable and this adrenaline rush makes you feel like you can achieve anything. </p>

                        <p>When it came to coming up with ideas for the name, design and purpose, we started off with a mind map which was made as a group. We discussed different concepts and names for the site, eventually coming up with a final idea. Later ideas were changed which were discussed in either a group chat on facebook, or group meetings in the labs. We would discuss current problems, improvements and likes and dislikes of page layouts and features of the site etc.</p>
